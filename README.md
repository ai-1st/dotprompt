# DotPrompt

DotPrompt is an innovative project that explores a radical approach to programming, where code is entirely generated by AI, and humans focus solely on editing the prompts used to produce the code.

## Introduction

In traditional programming, code is built through a series of iterations, either by humans or with AI assistance. However, the resulting code often lacks transparency regarding the prompts used to generate it. DotPrompt aims to change this paradigm by introducing a system where the entire codebase is produced by AI, and humans interact with the code by modifying the prompts used to generate it.

## Key Concepts

1. **`.prompt` Files**: These files contain the prompts used by AI to generate actual code files.
2. **Builder Script**: A simple script that executes the `.prompt` files to build the code.
3. **Self-Generation**: The builder script itself can be generated from a `.prompt` file, demonstrating the concept of self-replication.
4. **Multi-level Abstraction**: `.prompt` files can be built from other `.prompt` files, allowing for higher-level conceptualization.
5. **Reverse Engineering**: The potential to derive prompt files from existing source code.

## Features

- Generate entire codebases using AI-driven prompts
- Maintain a clear separation between prompts and generated code
- Enable easy modification and iteration of code by editing prompts
- Support for self-generating builder scripts
- Potential for multi-level abstraction in prompt creation

## Getting Started

(Instructions for setting up and running DotPrompt will be added here as the project develops)

## Usage

(Examples and guidelines for using DotPrompt will be provided here as the project matures)

## To-Do List

- Implement a templating engine for `.prompt` files to allow inclusion of other prompts and/or source files
- Develop a dependency graph analyzer for the builder script to determine the order of prompt execution
- Add support for generating multiple files from a single prompt
- Integrate unit test generation alongside code generation
- Implement automatic error correction based on test results and error messages
