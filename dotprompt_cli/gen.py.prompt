A python cli application, built using the "click" framework. It takes prompts 
stored in the local filesystem and produces code files, stored along with the prompts.

The prompt files have ".prompt" suffix. For example, a prompt to produce example.py 
will be stored in the example.py.prompt file.

To produce code from the prompt use ChatBedrock from langchain_aws package.
Use anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0 model in us-east-1 region.
Make sure you initialize the model exactly like this:
```
    chat = ChatBedrock(
        model_id="anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0",
        region_name="us-east-1"
    )
```

Use these system instructions for the AI:
<instructions>Output just the file content, nothing else. 
Do not enclose the code in triple quotes.</instructions>

Also provide a one-shot example, such as 
<user>Hello world in python</user>
<assistant>print('Hello world')</assistant>

Please avoid these errors and warnings:
ValueError: System message must be at beginning of message list.
