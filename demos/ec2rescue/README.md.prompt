Generate a README.md file using github markdown that describes the lambda function created
using the following prompt:

<prompt>
@include(handler.py.prompt)
</prompt>

There's also a cloudformation template named cf.yaml that deploys this lambda using all the necessary permissions.
<code>
@include(cf.yaml)
</code>

Please include the instructions on how to deploy this stack using aws cli, how to redeploy it, and
how to run the lambda function.
